(Add variations such as ""it's really confusing"", etc.)
Answer: If they are spending time with you, they love or like or care for you. We tend not to hang around people that we don't like. If we
didn't
like you, we wouldn't be around you at all.
That said, we're often very busy people. We can't just drop everything in an instant to spend time with you (unless it's really important, like someone being hospitalized or killed or something). If you need help from us that badly - we are there for those who are our friends. Not so much acquaintances or those in the outer circle of our friendship.
If you are in our absolute inner circle of friendship, we'll crawl across broken glass to help you."

Can you give me some examples of what actions or behaviors you would only do for one category but not the other.. like rearranging time to see you, or doing something very outside their comfort zone/never done before to comfort someone else?"

TBH, though, the redundancy of the questions won't stop if people are too lazy to use the search option to begin with. Assuming this thread gets to 500 pages or so, it will me much ""harder"" to search through this thread to find a question relating to yours, vs. searching thread titles.
Not only that, but those of us who answer said questions may not necessarily keep up with all the questions, causing the wounded to create new threads anyways.
I suppose my pessimism steams from me never checking threads i'm more than 10 pages behind on.
All in all, I support the idea in theory... just wanted to rain on your parade
I'm going to stop rambling now. Good Luck!"
